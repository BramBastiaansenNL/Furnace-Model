# Furnace-Model
A MATLAB-based simulation and optimization framework for modeling industrial heat treatment of aluminum alloy. The model captures transient heat transfer dynamics across multiple domains—furnace air, alloy, and multilayered furnace walls—using finite volume methods and incorporates radiative, convective, and conductive heat transfer mechanisms.
